# mHTTP
Today, most devices have multiple network interfaces. Coupled with wide-spread replication of popular content at multiple locations, this provides substantial path diversity in the Internet. Multi-source Multipath HTTP (mHTTP) can take advantage of these multiple types of path diversity in the Internet for boosting the speed of file fetching. mHTTP needs only client-side but not server-side or network modifications as it is a receiver-oriented mechanism. Moreover, the modifications are restricted to the socket interface. Thus, no changes are needed to the applications or to the kernel.
